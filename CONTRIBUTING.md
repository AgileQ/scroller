## Our Responsibilities

53

​

54

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable

55

behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in

56

response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

57

​

58

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or

59

reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions

60

that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or

61

permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,

62

threatening, offensive, or harmful.

63

​

64

## Scope

65

​

66

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces

67

when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of

68

representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail

69

address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed

70

representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be

71

further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

72

​

73

## Enforcement

74

​

75

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be

76

reported by contacting [username](https://github.com/[username]). All

77

complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that

78

is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is

79

obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

80

Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

81

​

82

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good

83

faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other

84

members of the project's leadership.
